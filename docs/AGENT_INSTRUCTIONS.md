# Codetriever Agent Instructions

**Ship fast. Test what matters. Don't overthink.**

## **CRITICAL** Prime Directives

1. **Trunk-based development** - Commit directly to main
2. **Red/Green/Refactor TDD** - Write failing test, make it pass, then refactor
3. **Idiomatic Rust always** - Use `clippy`, follow Rust patterns, no shortcuts
4. **Vibe-based coding** - Start with what feels right, iterate
5. **Test business logic only** - Not OS behavior or timing
6. **Ship working code daily** - Progress > perfection
7. **Use actionable TODO comments** - Write `// TODO: <specific action>` not vague comments like "currently" or "not implemented". Be explicit about what needs to be done
8. **End every coding response with**: "ALWAYS Follow Red/Green/Refactor TDD and Rust Idiomatic Best Practices" - This reminder ensures adherence to core principles
