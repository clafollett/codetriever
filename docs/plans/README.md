# Planning Documents

This directory contains planning and design documents created during the development of Codetriever. These documents represent the evolution of our thinking and architectural decisions.

## Document Status

### Current/Active Plans
- **`implementation-plan-2025-01-30.md`** - ‚úÖ CURRENT - Active implementation roadmap
- **`architecture.md`** - ‚úÖ CURRENT - Main architecture document (updated Jan 2025)
- **`api-design.md`** - ‚ö†Ô∏è REFERENCE - API endpoint specifications (partially implemented)

### Historical/Archived Plans
These documents are kept for historical context but may not reflect current implementation:

- **`content-based-architecture.md`** - üìö HISTORICAL - Early refactoring plan (completed differently)
- **`database-state-management.md`** - üìö HISTORICAL - Database design concepts (partially implemented)
- **`development-strategy.md`** - üìö HISTORICAL - Original dev approach (superseded by Docker-first)
- **`docker-architecture.md`** - üìö HISTORICAL - Docker design (implemented with modifications)
- **`installation-strategy.md`** - üìö HISTORICAL - Future installation plans (not yet relevant)

## How to Use These Documents

### For Contributors
1. Start with `implementation-plan-2025-01-30.md` for current work
2. Reference `architecture.md` for system design
3. Use `api-design.md` as the contract for API endpoints

### For Historical Context
The historical documents show:
- How we evolved from native development to Docker-first
- Why we chose content-based indexing over file-based
- The reasoning behind our database schema decisions
- Early thinking about installation and distribution

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Historical documents may contain outdated information!** Always verify against:
- Current code in the repository
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` for what's actually built
- `docs/architecture/current-architecture.md` for implementation details

## Document Evolution Timeline - 2 Weeks from Idea to Implementation! üöÄ

### The Origin Story
- **Week of Aug 26, 2025** - Lunchtime dog walks üêï
  - Initial brainstorming sessions via Claude mobile
  - Conceptualized semantic code search vision
  - Just two devs (human + AI) dreaming big

### The Sprint
1. **Aug 30, 2025 (Friday after work)** - Day 1: Foundation
   - Created initial project structure
   - Laid down planning docs (architecture, docker, installation)
   - Set up Python extraction pipeline for Claude exports
   - First commit at 2:36 PM EDT!

2. **Labor Day Weekend (Aug 31 - Sep 2)** - Days 2-4: Core Engine
   - Built entire indexing pipeline
   - Implemented Tree-sitter parsing for 25+ languages
   - Added Jina BERT embeddings
   - PostgreSQL + Qdrant integration
   - Content-based architecture refactor

3. **Sep 3-6, 2025** - Week 2: Making it Production-Ready
   - Added comprehensive database state management
   - Created storage abstractions (VectorStorage trait)
   - Implemented token counting abstractions
   - Built mock testing frameworks
   - Added connection pooling

4. **Sep 9, 2025** - Cleanup & Polish
   - Major architecture improvements
   - Security enhancements (removed hardcoded creds)
   - Added builder patterns
   - Comprehensive code review

5. **Sep 15, 2025 (Today)** - Documentation & Next Phase
   - Created implementation roadmap
   - Updated all docs to reflect reality
   - Ready to complete user interfaces (CLI/API)

### The Achievement üíØ
**In just 2 weeks**, we built:
- Complete semantic code search engine
- Production-ready indexing pipeline
- Multi-language support via Tree-sitter
- Vector embeddings with Jina BERT
- Dual storage (PostgreSQL + Qdrant)
- Docker infrastructure
- MCP server with 9 tools
- Comprehensive test framework
- Clean, idiomatic Rust architecture

**From dog walk idea to working system: 14 days!**
