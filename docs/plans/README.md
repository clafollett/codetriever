# Planning Documents

This directory contains planning and design documents created during the development of Codetriever. These documents represent the evolution of our thinking and architectural decisions.

## Document Status

### Current/Active Plans
- **`2025-09-15-implementation-plan.md`** - ‚úÖ CURRENT - Active implementation roadmap
- **`2025-09-15-architecture.md`** - ‚úÖ CURRENT - Main architecture document (updated Sep 2025)
- **`2025-09-15-api-design.md`** - ‚ö†Ô∏è REFERENCE - API endpoint specifications (partially implemented)
- **`2025-09-16-search_match_model.txt`** - üìê TECHNICAL - Search matching model specification
- **`2025-09-21-future-enhancements.md`** - üöÄ ROADMAP - Phase 3+ enhancement proposals
- **`2025-08-30-installation-strategy.md`** - üîÆ FUTURE - Installation and distribution plans

### Historical/Archived Plans
Archived docs are in `archives/` with implementation status notes. These represent decisions already made and features already built:

- **`2025-08-30-development-strategy.md`** - ‚úÖ Implemented via Candle device detection (Metal on Mac, CPU in Docker)
- **`2025-08-30-docker-architecture.md`** - ‚úÖ Implemented with PostgreSQL added
- **`2025-09-02-content-based-architecture.md`** - ‚úÖ Fully implemented, exceeded plan (10 crates)
- **`2025-09-21-database-state-management.md`** - ‚úÖ Fully implemented with schema enhancements

## How to Use These Documents

### For Contributors
1. Start with `2025-09-15-implementation-plan.md` for current work
2. Reference `2025-09-15-architecture.md` for system design
3. Use `2025-09-15-api-design.md` as the contract for API endpoints
4. Check `archives/` for context on past architectural decisions

### For Historical Context
The archived documents show:
- Why Metal/CPU dual-mode approach was chosen
- How Docker architecture evolved (added PostgreSQL)
- Transition to content-based architecture (10 modular crates)
- Database schema design decisions (branch-aware indexing, generations)

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Dates in document content may be hallucinated!** Trust the file datestamp prefix (`YYYY-MM-DD-`), not dates inside the files. Always verify against actual code.

## Document Evolution Timeline - 4 Weeks from Idea to Production! üöÄ

### The Origin Story
- **Week of Aug 26, 2025** - Lunchtime dog walks üêï
  - Initial brainstorming sessions via Claude mobile
  - Conceptualized semantic code search vision
  - Just two devs (human + AI) dreaming big

### The Sprint
1. **Aug 30, 2025 (Friday after work)** - Day 1: Foundation
   - Created initial project structure
   - Laid down planning docs (architecture, docker, installation)
   - First commit at 2:36 PM EDT!

2. **Labor Day Weekend (Sep 1-2, 2025)** - Days 2-4: Core Engine
   - Built entire indexing pipeline
   - Implemented Tree-sitter parsing for 25+ languages
   - Added Jina BERT embeddings via Candle
   - PostgreSQL + Qdrant integration
   - Content-based architecture refactor

3. **Sep 3-15, 2025** - Weeks 2-3: Production-Ready
   - Added comprehensive database state management
   - Created storage abstractions (VectorStorage trait)
   - Implemented token counting abstractions
   - Built mock testing frameworks
   - Added connection pooling
   - Security enhancements
   - Branch-aware indexing with generations

4. **Sep 16-21, 2025** - Week 4: Modularization & Enhancement
   - Broke monolith into 10 focused crates
   - Enhanced database schema (byte offsets, author tracking)
   - Added file move detection
   - Comprehensive testing framework
   - Dynamic OpenAPI generation

5. **Sep 30, 2025** - Stability & Quality
   - Fixed CI/CD lint issues
   - Improved error handling across all crates
   - Fixed critical SQL bugs
   - Security audits

### The Achievement üíØ
**In just 4 weeks**, we built:
- Complete semantic code search engine
- Production-ready indexing pipeline
- Multi-language support via Tree-sitter
- Vector embeddings with Jina BERT (Candle-powered, Metal on Mac)
- Dual storage (PostgreSQL + Qdrant)
- Docker infrastructure (dev/data/prod compose files)
- MCP server with 9 tools
- 10 modular, focused crates
- Comprehensive test framework
- Branch-aware indexing with generation tracking
- Clean, idiomatic Rust architecture
