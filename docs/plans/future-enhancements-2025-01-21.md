# Future Enhancement Plans - Phase 3 and Beyond
*Generated: January 21, 2025*

## Status
This document captures future enhancement ideas identified after completing the massive Phase 2 configuration architecture migration. These represent potential Phase 3+ initiatives that build upon our newly unified, type-safe configuration system.

## Context
Following the successful completion of Phase 2 (configuration duplication elimination across all 5 crates), we now have a solid foundation for advanced operational and architectural improvements. The unified configuration system provides the groundwork for these enhancements.
